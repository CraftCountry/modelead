# Lead's Lovely Mod
Minecraft Forge Mod for Minecraft 1.7.10. Aiming to make a mod for end-game: hard to find ore, expensive items and uber tools/armor.

New items and features are added continiously...

# Crops
Amongst the tall grass you can find rare seeds that will grow the Deal Crops. When full grown they will drop a new seed and an Unobtainium Sharp.

# Unobtainium progression
Unobtainium can be found is small quantities in the deepest crevices of the world. The orad to follow to make something usefull out of it is hard and long. It also requires a shitload of resources and time, but the final result is satisfying.

# Tools
One of the very few rare earth metals is Whish Alloy, it is used to make the most powerfull tools
- Whish Sword
- Whish Pickaxe

# Food
Apples are good for your healt, you've found a way to upgrade them to a Thought Apple. These will also fill your needs with the hunger bar full.

An upgraded version, the Whish Apple, fills you up like crazy and leaves behind some proper effects.

# Lead Biome
There are still nice places on the map to explore...

# Armor
When you finally have Whish Armor, it's time to make some decent armor from it
