# Lead's Lovely Mod
Minecraft Forge Mod for Minecraft 1.7.10. Aiming to make a mod for end-game: hard to find ore, expensive items and uber tools/armor.

New items and features are added continiously...

# Deal Crops
Amongst the tall grass you can find rare seeds that will grow the Deal Crops. When full grown they will drop a new seed and an Unobtainium Shard.

# Unobtainium progression
Unobtainium can be found is small quantities in the deepest crevices of the world and in random places in lava in the Nether. The orad to follow to make something usefull out of it is hard and long. It also requires a shitload of resources and time, but the final result is satisfying. Minimum mining level is Diamond, so bring the proper tool.

# Whish Tools
One of the very few rare earth metals is Whish Alloy, it is used to make the most powerfull tools
- Whish Sword
- Whish Pickaxe

# Whish Biome
There are still nice places on the map to explore...

# Whish Tree
A tree in a distinct shape, offering a nice chunk of wood in the top, there are little sapling drops so use the saplings you have wisely.

# Rambutan
The Rambutan are the drops from the Whish Tree.

# Rambutan Fruit
The drops from the Whish Tree (Rambutan) can be peeled and the fruits are nutricious on its onw but can be upgraded to Thought Fruits and ultimately to Whish Fruit. The latter is a true Super Fruit so you are ready for your fearest battles.

# Thought Soil
This is an improved type of dirt, all plants can grow on it, doing it a bit faster than on regular dirt. It is also a component in the process of making Whish Soil, the ultimate base for your garden.

# Whish Armor
When you finally have Whish Armor, it's time to make some decent armor from it. A full set can be produced: helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots.
